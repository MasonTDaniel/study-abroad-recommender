This course is designed to increase awareness and knowledge of cross cultural differences in sexual attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, students will learn how sex education, sex work, and sexual health differ in the Netherlands compared to the United States.  In addition to this in-depth comparative analysis of sexuality, students will study the history of marginalized groups in the Netherlands, including the LGBT community. Students will also be immersed in Dutch culture through guided tours, visits to museums, and participation in other cultural activities. There are no prerequisites for this program.
